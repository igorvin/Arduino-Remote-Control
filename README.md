##Remote control system based on Arduino and HC-12 long range module

I created this project to help my friend extend existing remote control system and add additional commands to his project.<br />
This project contains two separated projects Transmitter and Receiver.
Both was created on Microsoft Visual Studio.<br />
Arduino files you can find by the following links:<br />
Transmitter: https://github.com/igorvin/Arduino-Remote-Control/blob/master/Transmitter/Transmitter/Transmitter.ino<br />
Receiver: https://github.com/igorvin/Arduino-Remote-Control/blob/master/Receiver/Receiver/Receiver.ino<br />
The project was created and tested on Arduino version 1.6.6<br />

##Specifications

**Libraries:**<br />
		**EEPROM**- Built in Arduino library. Ability to write to Eeprom memory<br />
		**Servo**-  Built in Arduino library. Enable Servo motors<br />
		**SoftwareSerial**- Built in Arduino library. Enable software serial for HC-12 module<br />
		**EasyTransfer**-[http://www.billporter.info/2011/05/30/easytransfer-arduino-library/](http://www.billporter.info/2011/05/30/easytransfer-arduino-library/"). Easy transfer data between two arduino

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License
