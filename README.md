##Remote control system based on Arduino and HC-12 long range module

I created this project to help my friend extend existing remote control system and add additional commands to his project.
This project contains two separeted projects Transmitter and Receiver.
Both was created on Microsoft Visual Studio
Arduino files you can find by the following links:
Transmitter: https://github.com/igorvin/Arduino-Remote-Control/blob/master/Transmitter/Transmitter/Transmitter.ino
Receiver: https://github.com/igorvin/Arduino-Remote-Control/blob/master/Receiver/Receiver/Receiver.ino
The project was created and tested on Arduino version 1.6.6

##Specifications

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

##Specifications
#--Transmitter--

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License
